# Retro-Commander
Retro-Commander is a graphical application developed in Java and JavaFX that implements a specific UART serial port protocol to communicate with external standalone devices. 
This app implements a custom protocol to provide an emulation of all primary I/O interfaces to avoid the necessity of other external hardware like monitors,
keyboards and hard disk/floppy disks.
